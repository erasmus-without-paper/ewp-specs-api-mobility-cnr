Release notes
=============

This document describes all the changes made to the *Interinstitutional
Agreement CNR API* document, starting from its first beta draft version.


0.2.0
-----

* Changed XML namespaces (as part of
  [this issue](https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/ewp-specs-api-iias/issues/22)).
  Since this version, this API is in the `stable-v1` XML namespace.

  This does not mean that this API is stable. It can still change in
  backward-incompatible ways, until version `1.0.0` is released.


0.1.1
-----

* `minOccurs` and `maxOccurs` are now provided explicitly
  ([why?](https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/general-issues/issues/22)).

* Updated links.


0.1.0
-----

Initial release.
